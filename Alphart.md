##Prj Alphart

This helps people to learn more about typography and allows them to send custom messages/greetings to their loved ones with their own font/handwritting.

Allow them to send msg right away. In this workflow, people will be able to type their text without tracing any fonts or characters.

Once the msg is finalised, app will prompt them to trace the characters used in the msg first. 
They should be able to select the font type in which they want to send.




###My note:

For kids

- display A on left, ask them to draw on right
- different fonts
- letters only? simple words?


My font 

- Select a font
- Show random uncompleted char in left
- Draw pad on right
- Save it to svg
- Convert the collection as font later.
