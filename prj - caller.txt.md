###Caller

* headset connected
* read contact name
* fetch caller name

####Update:
Idea is if mobile is connected to headset, instead of playing caller ringtone, if the no. is a contact, "say" contact name.

This idea preceeds any smart bands/watches I was using original iphone at the time. 

Thought it would be helpful in public transit (remember peak hours in India...)
